            <p className='aboutMeText' >Hello there! I am Tamer, a full-stack web developer from Westchester, NY. I have a big passion for crafting new and exciting web experiences. I enjoy connecting both technology and creativity together to create something new and innovative. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I am a recent graduated from Columbia University BootCamp for Software Engineering, where I developed my skills and delved deep into the world of full-stack web development. With these skills I was able to build sleek user interfaces to robust backend systems- such as creating applications using Computer Science Applied to JavaScript Databases (MySQL, MongoDB), Server Side Development (MERN Stack, Progressive Web Applications), Browser-Based Technologies (React, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap), Deployment/Command-Line Fundamentals (Heroku, Git), API Interaction (API, JSON, AJAX) and Quality Assurance (Unit Testing, Linting, Continuous Integration).
